# Habit Development and Tracking Application

## Overview

This repository houses the source code for the **Habit Development and Tracking Application**. The application aims to address issues related to disorganized habits and self-discipline challenges. Leveraging insights from science and human psychology, the proposed solution educates users on the health benefits of improving routines. The application is designed to assist individuals in creating, modifying, and eliminating habits through research-proven techniques. It features a robust follow-up system, rewards, and penalties, with a core mechanism focused on enhancing cognitive memory and overall well-being.
